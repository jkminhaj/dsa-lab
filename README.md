# **DSA Lab Semester Final - 1st Year (C++)**

This repository contains solutions and implementations for various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems written in **C++** for the semester final.

## **How to Use**

### **Option 1: Run Locally**
1. Ensure you have a **C++ compiler** set up on your PC (e.g., GCC, Clang).
2. Copy the code into a `.cpp` file.
3. Compile and execute the program in your terminal or IDE.  
   Example using GCC:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

### **Option 2: Use an Online Compiler**
If you donâ€™t have a compiler installed, you can use any of these online C++ compilers to test the code:

- [Programiz Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/)
- [GeeksforGeeks IDE](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [Replit (C++)](https://replit.com/)
- [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)

### Steps:
1. Open any of the above links.
2. Paste the code into the online editor.
3. Hit the **Run** button to execute the program.
