# **DSA Lab Semester Final - 1st Year (C++)**

This repository contains solutions and implementations for various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems written in **C++** for the semester final.

## **How to Use**

### **#Option 1: Run Locally#**
1. Ensure you have a **C++ compiler** set up on your PC (e.g., GCC, Clang).
   - If you already have a compiler installed, simply **@copy the code@** into a `.cpp` file and run it using your compiler.
2. Compile and execute the program in your terminal or IDE.
   Example using GCC:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
